## Timeline

| Phase   | Duration | Start Date | End Date |
| ------- | -------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Phase 1 | 2 weeks  | Week 1     | Week 2   |
| Phase 2 | 3 weeks  | Week 3     | Week 5   |
| Phase 3 | 4 weeks  | Week 6     | Week 9   |
| Phase 4 | 3 weeks  | Week 10    | Week 12  |

| Phase 6 | 4 weeks  | Week 15    | Week 18  |
| Phase 7 | 2 weeks  | Week 19    | Week 20  |

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Test coverage > 80%
- Build performance < 5 seconds for small projects
- Query response time < 100ms
- Zero security vulnerabilities

### Business Metrics
- Developer adoption rate
- Time saved in Nix operations
- Reduction in configuration errors
- Improved system reliability

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Nix CLI Changes**: Version pin Nix, monitor for breaking changes
2. **Performance Issues**: Implement caching, optimize queries
3. **Complex Dependencies**: Use incremental resolution
4. **Platform Differences**: Comprehensive testing matrix

### Operational Risks
1. **Resource Constraints**: Implement resource limits
2. **Data Loss**: Regular backups, event sourcing
3. **Service Availability**: Circuit breakers, fallbacks
4. **Security Breaches**: Regular audits, minimal permissions

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Nix 2.18+ (for flakes support)
- NATS JetStream (for event streaming)
- Bevy 0.16+ (for visualization)
- Rust 1.75+ (for async traits)

### Internal Dependencies
- cim-domain (core domain infrastructure)
- cim-infrastructure (event store, messaging)
- cim-ipld (content addressing)

## Review Points

- End of each phase: Technical review
- Mid-project: Architecture review
- Pre-production: Security review
- Post-launch: Performance review

## Next Steps

1. Complete Phase 1 documentation
2. Begin Phase 2 implementation
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline
4. Create developer onboarding guide
5. Schedule architecture review
